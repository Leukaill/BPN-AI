# Denyse AI Assistant

## Overview
Denyse is a luxurious AI chatbot application designed for intelligent document processing and report generation, specifically specializing in Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E). It offers a secure, premium AI assistant experience with document upload capabilities, AI-powered chat, and sophisticated report writing features, all within a Gemini-inspired interface. The project aims to provide a secure and efficient tool for M&E professionals.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language. User prefers more natural, ChatGPT-like responses - conversational, helpful, and engaging while maintaining professionalism.

M&E Focus: User specifically requested AI to be specialized in Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) rather than general business analysis. Reports should focus on M&E best practices, frameworks, outcomes, indicators, and impact assessment.

Interactive Questioning: User wants AI to proactively ask clarifying questions before generating reports to better understand user needs and create more targeted, valuable outputs. This should be implemented with "highest creativity" to make the feature exceptional.
